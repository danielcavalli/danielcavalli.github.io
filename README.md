<b><h3>About</h3></b>
This is my portfolio. It's a little non-sense at the time but I'll make it the best portfolio you ever seen, trust me. 

<b><h1>Features</h1></b> 

<b><h4>Rainbow Thing</h4></b>
 The Rainbow Thing is a feature implemented when I was in a deep  state of sleepwalkiness (and this description was written with me in the same state - of half working of my brain.) and because of that I don't know why it is here. Just accept. It's a function that changes the site color to another one in the list.

<b><h4>Stress Button</h4></b>
 Are you stressed? Just press the "Don't Click" Button and laugh al ittle.
 
<b><h4>Random Phrases</h4></b>
 Ten phrases will be drawn to show when you load the page, there will be some information about varied topics, most fo them curiosities about me.
