<b><h3>About</h3></b>
This is my portfolio. It's a little non-sense at the time but I'll make it the best portfolio you ever seen, trust me. 

<b><h1>Features</h1></b> 

<b><h4>Rainbow Thing</h4></b>
 The Rainbow Thing is a feature implemented when I was in a deep  state of sleepwalkiness (and this description was written with me in the same state - of half working of my brain.) and because of that I don't know why it is here. Just accept. It's a function that changes the site color to another one in the list.

<b><h4>Depressive Button</h4></b>
 He hates life. He wanted be dead now but he can't, he isn't strong enough to kill himself. So what he does is make the life of people around him more shit possible . He needs a Doctor, someone help him.
