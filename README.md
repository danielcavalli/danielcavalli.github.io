<b><h3>About</h3></b>
This is my portfolio. It's a little non-sense at the time but I'll make it the best portfolio you ever seen, trust me. The first page works as an Access Page, there you can go to the Portfolio or the Coin Graph App. This will be replaced later, the first page will be Portfolio page and ther you'll be able to access the CoinGraph web site.

<b><h1>CoinGraph Features</h1></b> 

<b><h4>BitCoin price watcher</h4></b>
In the main page of the project you can track the value of the most important e-currency in the world and its minion coin.

<b><h4>Currency Chart</h4></b>
Right now it is a feature under development but will be here soon. It'll show the market cap of Bitcoin to be easier to follow its ups and downs through the time.

<b><h4>Move Advisor</h4></b>
It is an algorithim that analyzes the flow chart of BitCoin through the day and saves the data into a Data Base. After doing that it uses the data previous collected to figure some "pattern" of the ups and dows of the currency.This algorithm bases its woking in the regular operations people do with the currency during the day. It is the only way to find a "pattern".

<b><h1>PortFolio Features</h1></b> 

<b><h4>Rainbow Thing</h4></b>
 The Rainbow Thing is a feature implemented when I was in a deep  state of sleepwalkiness (and this description was written with me in the same state - of half working of my brain.) and because of that I don't know why it is here. Just accept. It's a function that changes the site color to another one in the list.

<b><h4>Depressive Button</h4></b>
 He hates life. He wanted be dead now but he can't, he isn't strong enough to kill himself. So what he does is make the life of people around him more shit possible . He needs a Doctor, someone help him.
